Exercise - Machine Learning
Ariane Nunes Alves

In this exercise, you will learn how to predict dissociation rate constants for a group of molecules using decision trees and random forest.

This exercise is optional and assumes basic knowledge of python and jupyter notebooks acquired, for example, in the ACC course.

This exercise may not work in the UnixPool.
Instead, you have two options:
1- you can install conda in your computer:
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html

Create a conda environment, and install the required packages:
- Scikit-learn
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html
- Numpy
https://numpy.org/install/
- Pandas
https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html
- Matplotlib
https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html

Once your conda environment is activated, you can open your jupyter notebook with the following command:
jupyter notebook random-forest.ipynb

2- use Google Colab, and install the required packages there (ask more information about it, if you are interested):
https://colab.research.google.com/
