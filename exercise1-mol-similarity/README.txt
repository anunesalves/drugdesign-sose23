Exercise - Molecular similarity
Ariane Nunes Alves

In this exercise, you will learn how to use the python library RDkit to read SMILES strings, draw molecules and compute molecular similarity. 

This exercise is optional and assumes basic knowledge of python and jupyter notebooks acquired, for example, in the ACC course.

This exercise may not work in the UnixPool due to problems to install RDkit.
Instead, it is recommended to install conda in your computer:
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html

Create a conda environment, and install the required packages:
- RDkit
https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html
- Numpy
https://numpy.org/install/
- Seaborn
https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html
- Matplotlib
https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html

Once your conda environment is activated, you can open your jupyter notebook with the following command:
jupyter notebook exercise-similarity.ipynb
